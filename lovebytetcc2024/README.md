# Lovebyte Tiny Code Christmas 2024

These are some of the Tiny Code Christmas challenges done in **flitter**. The
source code is deliberately compact for each of these (following on from the
"tiny" bit of the challenge). As **flitter** is fairly verbose compared to the
TIC-80 code that formed the basis of the original event, the attempt in each
case is to produce code less than 400 characters in total.
